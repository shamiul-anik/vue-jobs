# Project Overview

## Description
Vue Jobs is a full-stack job board application designed to demonstrate a production-grade architecture using Vue.js 3 and Node.js/Express. It features a clean, responsive UI, secure authentication, and a robust RESTful API.

## Key Features
- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Vue.js frontend + Express.js backend + SQLite database.
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based auth with HttpOnly cookies.
- **Job Management**: CRUD operations for job listings (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **Search & Filter**: Real-time job filtering and search capabilities.
- **Performance**: Optimized with Vite, multiple caching layers, and database WAL mode.
- **Monitoring**: Integration with PostHog for error tracking and session replay.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized services (Backend, Frontend/Nginx) orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Goals
- Serve as a reference for modern Vue.js and Node.js best practices.
- Demonstrate secure and scalable application design.
- Provide a real-world complexity level beyond simple to-do apps.
